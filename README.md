# ranger

ranger is a top-down shooter written in Rust through the [Bevy Game Engine](https://bevyengine.org/).

It's based on a game I made in scratch during a 9th grade project.
As it stands, I'm simply trying to recreate it. Though I would like to expand it.

What follows is a checklist of goals I will set for myself:

- [] get basic proof-of-concept working
- [] grid-based collision detection (and resolution)
- [] basic enemy pathfinding
- [] texturing
- [] UI
